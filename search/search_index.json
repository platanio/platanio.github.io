I serve as the co-chair for ICASSP2027.  During my tenure as Vice President, SPS membership has constantly increased, especially in student and graduate student grades; many member-driven initiatives were introduced, and most of our affinity groups were established. </p> <p>Entrepreneur:  I am a registered professional engineer with first-hand engagement and a keen appreciation of industry and academia. I co-founded Medical Cytometrix Inc. My research led to technology commercialization, including intellectual property transfer to industry, patent licensing (machine intelligence start-up), HURON Digital Pathology (computational pathology), and Canadian government (Crown \u2013 Department of National Defence, Canada). </p> <p>Professor: I am a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering and the Bell Canada Chair Professor in Multimedia since 2014 at the University of Toronto (UofT), which ranks in the top 20 global research universities. I am the Director for the Machine Intelligence Major at UofT's elite Engineering Science program. My research group conducts research encompassing broad areas of machine learning, adaptive systems, image processing, and biomedical signal processing. </p> <p>Awards/Honors: I am humbled to see my work capturing the attention of my peers (Google Scholar: Citations: 29,000 +, h-index: 83, i10-index:350). Research.com recognizes me as a leading researcher, ranked 550 globally and 33rd in electrical and electronics engineering in Canada. I also rank 913 globally and 34 in Canada in computer science (2023 Edition). I am a Fellow of IEEE, a Fellow of the Engineering Institute of Canada, and a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering. I received the J.M. Ham IEEE Canada Outstanding Engineering Educator Award, the 2006 IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks Best Paper Award and a 2018 IET paper award.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"bio_statement/","title":"Biography and Statement","text":"IEEE Signal Processing Society President-Elect (2024-2025) <p>Short Bio: Konstantinos N. Plataniotis received his B.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Patras, Greece, followed by an M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida. He is presently a Professor at The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada, where he directs the Multimedia Laboratory. He has held the Bell Canada Endowed Chair in Multimedia since 2014. Dr. Plataniotis is a registered professional engineer in Ontario and a Fellow of IEEE, the Engineering Institute of Canada, and the Canadian Academy of Engineering/ L'Academie Canadienne Du Genie. His primary research areas include image/signal processing, machine learning and adaptive learning systems, visual data analysis, multimedia and knowledge media, and affective computing. </p> <p></p> <p>Contact Information:</p> <p>Professor and Bell Canada Chair in Multimedia  University of Toronto, ON, M5S3G4, CANADA   T: +1 416 946 5605; F: +1 416 978 4425   E: kostas@ece.utoronto.ca, kostas.plataniotis@utoronto.ca  W: www.comm.utoronto.ca/~kostas  L: https://plataniotis.my.canva.site/ </p> <p>IEEE Signal Processing Society, President-Elect (2024-2025)  W: https://signalprocessingsociety.org/  W: www.plataniotis.com  E: k.n.plataniotis@ieee.org </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Contact Information</p> <p> </p> <p>Konstantinos N (Kostas) Plataniotis, Ph.D., P.Eng., FIEEE, FEIC, FCAE  Professor, Bell Canada Chair in Multimedia  Department of ECE, University of Toronto  Toronto, ON, M5S3G4, CANADA  T: +1 416 946 5605  F: +1 416 978 4425  Email: kostas@ece.utoronto.ca Website: https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/plataniotis-k-n/ </p> <p>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kostas-plataniotis-b360811/ Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W-4N_2gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</p>"},{"location":"info/","title":"This is an Info Page","text":"<p>For full documentation visit mkdocs.org.</p>"},{"location":"info/#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"info/#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"assets/images/academicons/","title":"What is Academicons?","text":"<p>Academicons is a specialist icon font for academics. It contains icons for websites and organisations related to academia that are often missing from mainstream font packages. It can be used by itself, but its primary purpose is to be used as a supplementary package alongside a larger icon set. Go here to view the full icon set along with instructions for their use.</p>"},{"location":"assets/images/academicons/#requesting-new-icons","title":"Requesting new icons","text":"<p>New icons can be requested by creating an issue here. Before submitting a request, please check that the following conditions are satisfied:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The organisation in question is already using a logo/icon of appropriate dimensions (roughly square). If that doesn't exist, then there's really not much that can be done, and the request will have to be ignored until such time that a logo/icon can be provided.</p> </li> <li> <p>An icon of appropriate resolution can be provided or linked to. Ideally, the provided file will be a vector file (e.g. SVG, EPS, AI) or a PDF with the vector file embedded. These files are all very easy to work with, and result in the most faithful reproductions of the icon. Altenatively, high resolution raster images (e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF) can work, but only if the resolution is high enough that the underlying shapes can be reproduced. Icons made from raster images take much longer to prepare, and require hand drawing each component and figuring out the exact typeface used for any letters. This process can be rather tedious, and I will only do this if there is significant demand for the icon. Favicon files can be useful in conjunction with larger logos that have non-ideal aspect ratios\u2014where they can indicate which part of the logo to strip down to\u2014but they are pretty much useless by themselves. The only time I have made an icon from a favicon was for arXiv, and that was only because: (i) It was heavily requested, and (ii) I was able to get feedback on the new icon from Paul Ginsparg, who made the original icon. You can still submit the request, but it will likely be ignored until someone else comes along and provides the file we need.</p> </li> <li> <p>The icon can be reduced to monochrome. This is one of the basic requirements of a versatile icon, but it is often overlooked when icons are made by people who are not professional designers. Academia is full of unprofessional designers, and it is sometimes the case that a logo relies entirely on the use of different colours. In certain cases we can be creative (see the dblp logo), but more often than not it will be impossible to create a monochrome version of the icon. Again, feel free to make the request, but it will probably be ignored if an alternate logo cannot be found.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"assets/images/academicons/#license","title":"License","text":"<ul> <li>The Academicons font is licensed under the SIL OFL 1.1:</li> <li>http://scripts.sil.org/OFL</li> <li>Academicons CSS, LESS, and SASS files are licensed under the MIT License:</li> <li>http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html</li> <li>The Academicons documentation is licensed under the CC BY 3.0 License:</li> <li>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"assets/images/academicons/#author","title":"Author","text":"<ul> <li>GitHub: https://github.com/jpswalsh</li> <li>Web: http://jpswalsh.com</li> </ul>"}]}
