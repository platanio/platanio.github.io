### Dear colleagues,

This yearâ€™s IEEE Signal Processing Society election has started. As an SPS-nominated candidate for the SPS President-elect position, I am honoured to have the opportunity to serve you and our SPS community. 
I have been an SPS member for over 30 years and have served SPS in many roles, including inaugural VP-Membership, Editor-in-Chief, and General Co-Chair for its flagship conferences. I aim to empower our SPS members to advance their careers, increase our appeal to the industry, further promote our technical excellence, and improve operational efficiency.
